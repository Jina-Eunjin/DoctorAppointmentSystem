# DoctorAppointmentSystem
A full-stack doctor appointment booking system built using React JS, MongoDB, Express JS, and Node JS. This website was created by following a YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRTTlS0zaW8&t=46211s), with some modifications. I replaced the original payment system with Stripe for better security and a smoother user experience.
